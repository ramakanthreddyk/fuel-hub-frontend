# QA API Test Report (2026-07-10)

Attempted to run comprehensive Jest/Supertest tests following LOCAL_DEV_SETUP.md and STEP_fix_20260710_COMMAND.md.

## Steps
1. Installed PostgreSQL locally using `apt-get install postgresql` and started the service.
2. Created `fuelsync` user and `fuelsync_hub` database, then applied `backend/migrations/schema/001_initial_schema.sql`.
3. Installed backend dependencies with `npm install` and created `.env` from `.env.development`.
4. Executed `npm run setup-db` which failed due to missing columns during migrations.
5. Ran `npx jest -c backend/jest.config.ts` which prompted to install Jest interactively.

## Result
Database setup did not complete and Jest could not run because packages were missing. No test suites were executed.

## Conclusion
Automated API testing requires a clean database initialized with all migrations and Jest packages preinstalled. The environment again prevented tests from running.
