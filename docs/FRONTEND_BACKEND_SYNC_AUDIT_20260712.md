# Frontend–Backend Sync Audit (2026-07-12)

Following `STEP_audit_20260712_COMMAND.md` we reviewed the React API clients in `src/api`, backend routes under `backend/src/routes`, and the OpenAPI specification (`docs/openapi-spec.yaml`).

## 🔍 Missing API Usage
- `/api/v1/fuel-deliveries`: Implemented and used in `fuel-deliveries.ts` ✅
- `/api/v1/admin/*` routes: implemented but only partially used in SuperAdmin pages ✅
- `/api/v1/setup-status`: used by `useSetupStatus` hook ✅
- No unused backend routes were found. All frontend API modules map to existing endpoints.

## ⚠️ Response Mismatches
- No mismatched fields were detected between `api-contract.ts` types and OpenAPI schemas. Response helpers normalise casing.

## 🛑 Auth / Role Issues
- Frontend `ProtectedRoute` components enforce role guards and attach Bearer tokens via `apiClient` interceptor.
- Backend routes under `/api/v1/admin` correctly require SuperAdmin role. Other routes check Owner/Manager/Attendant as expected.

## ❌ Missing Business Logic
- Plan limits and reconciliation approval logic are enforced in services and surfaced in dashboards. No missing UI toggles were observed.

## ✅ Fully Synced Features
- Readings ➜ Sales generation
- Station/Pump/Nozzle CRUD
- Inventory tracking & alerts
- Reports & analytics dashboards
- SuperAdmin management pages

Overall the frontend and backend are in sync. Automated integration tests have been added to verify that documented GET endpoints respond.
