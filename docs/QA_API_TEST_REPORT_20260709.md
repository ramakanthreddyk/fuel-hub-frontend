# QA API Test Report (2026-07-09)

Attempted to execute automated API tests using Jest and Supertest as per docs/STEP_fix_20260709_COMMAND.md.

## Steps
1. Ran `npm install` inside `backend/` to install dependencies.
2. Ran `npm run setup-db` which failed with connection errors because PostgreSQL was unreachable.
3. Invoked `npx jest -c jest.config.ts` which attempted to install Jest and then awaited user input.

## Result
Testing could not proceed due to missing database and interactive package installation prompts. No test suites were executed.

## Conclusion
Automated API tests require a running PostgreSQL instance and preinstalled Jest packages. The environment lacked these prerequisites, so all tests were skipped.
