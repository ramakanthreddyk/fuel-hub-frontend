# QA API Test Report (2026-07-11)

Following STEP_fix_20260711_COMMAND.md, we attempted to execute end-to-end API tests with Jest and Supertest.

## Steps
1. Installed Jest and Supertest packages via `npm install --save-dev jest ts-jest @types/jest supertest`.
2. Updated `backend/package.json` test script to run Jest with the project config.
3. Ran `npm run setup-db` which failed to connect to PostgreSQL (ECONNREFUSED).
4. Ran `npm test` which attempted to create a test database but also failed due to connection errors.

## Result
No migrations or seeds were applied because the database connection could not be established. Jest output indicated "Skipping tests: unable to provision test DB." No suites were executed.

## Conclusion
Local automated API testing still requires a running PostgreSQL instance. The dependencies are now installed and the test script is configured, but without a database the tests cannot run.
