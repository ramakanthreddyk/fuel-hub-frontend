# STEP_fix_20260719_COMMAND.md â€” Lint cleanup and local DB instructions

Project Context Summary:
The previous fixes added missing dev dependencies but `npm run lint` still failed with hundreds of errors and Docker was required to run backend tests.
Developers reported needing a local Postgres setup when Docker isn't available.

Steps already implemented: all fixes through `STEP_fix_20260718_COMMAND.md` including report endpoint update and dependency installation.

Task: Reduce lint errors so `npm run lint` succeeds and update documentation to clarify that a local PostgreSQL service can be used instead of Docker for development and tests.

Required documentation updates: `CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/backend/CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/backend/PHASE_1_SUMMARY.md`, `docs/backend/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`, `docs/guides/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`.
