npx vitest run

# Run tests in watch mode
npx vitest

# Run tests for a specific file
npx vitest run src/path/to/test.ts
```

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is available in the `docs` directory:

- [Getting Started](docs/getting-started/README.md)
- [Architecture](docs/architecture/README.md)
- [API Integration](docs/api/integration-guide.md)
- [Component System](docs/components/README.md)
- [User Journeys](docs/journeys/README.md)

## Development Guidelines

### Component Organization
- Use the Shadcn UI component library for consistent UI
- Place component-specific styles in the same directory as the component
- Use TypeScript interfaces for component props

### State Management
- Use React Query for server state management
- Use Zustand for client-side state management
- Prefer local component state for UI-only state

### API Integration
- Use the API services in `src/api/services` for data fetching
- Use React Query hooks for data fetching, caching, and synchronization

### Formatting and Linting
- The project uses ESLint for code linting
- Run linting with `npm run lint` or `bun run lint`
- Follow the existing code style for consistency

### Performance Considerations
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Use useMemo and useCallback hooks for expensive calculations

## ðŸ§ª Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test file
npm run test -- button.test.tsx
```
