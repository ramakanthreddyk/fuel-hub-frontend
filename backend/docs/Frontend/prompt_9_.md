Great! Here's the next combined **Lovable Prompt for Prompt 9 (Fuel Delivery Log)** and **Prompt 10 (Fuel Inventory View)**.

---

### üõ¢Ô∏è Lovable Prompt: Fuel Delivery Logging + Fuel Inventory View

We are building **FuelSync Hub**, a multi-tenant ERP system for fuel stations. This prompt covers two operational features for managers: logging fuel deliveries and tracking real-time inventory levels.

Framework: **React 18 + Vite + TypeScript**
Libraries: **Tailwind CSS**, **shadcn/ui**, **React Query**
Auth: **JWT-based**, with tenant context via `x-tenant-id` header
Use React Router for navigation.

---

## üöö PART 1 ‚Äî Fuel Delivery Logging

**Route:** `/dashboard/fuel-deliveries`

### üìã View Past Deliveries Table

Display all deliveries made to the selected station (default to user's assigned station).
Columns:

* Fuel Type (petrol / diesel)
* Volume Received
* Delivered By
* Delivery Date

```http
GET /v1/fuel-deliveries?stationId=<station_id>
Headers: { x-tenant-id }
```

---

### ‚ûï Log New Delivery

Show form at the top or modal.

**Form Fields:**

* Station (select if multi-station; else auto-filled)
* Fuel Type (dropdown: petrol, diesel)
* Volume (number ‚Äì litres)
* Delivery Date (default to now)
* Delivered By (optional text)

```http
POST /v1/fuel-deliveries
Headers: { x-tenant-id }
Body:
{
  "stationId": "uuid",
  "fuelType": "petrol",
  "volume": 3000,
  "deliveryDate": "2025-06-22",
  "deliveredBy": "IOCL"
}
```

---

## üßØ PART 2 ‚Äî Fuel Inventory View

**Route:** `/dashboard/inventory`

This shows current available stock in each station by fuel type.

**Table Fields:**

* Station Name
* Fuel Type
* Available Volume
* Last Updated (ISO datetime)

```http
GET /v1/fuel-inventory?stationId=<id>&fuelType=<petrol|diesel>
Headers: { x-tenant-id }
```

Call this once per station + fuel type or fetch all and filter client-side if backend supports it.

## üß© Components to Build

| Component            | Purpose                           |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `DeliveryTable.tsx`  | List of fuel deliveries           |
| `DeliveryForm.tsx`   | Log a new delivery                |
| `InventoryTable.tsx` | Show current volume per fuel type |

---

## üìå Notes for Lovable

* Protect all routes with auth guard
* Include tenant header in all requests
* Allow search and filter by fuel type / date range
* Highlight low stock in red (if volume < threshold like 500L)

‚úÖ Backend is ready. You may proceed to build both modules as specified. Let us know when complete ‚Äî next up is daily reconciliation flow and audit-ready exports.


Perfect ‚Äî here's the **updated and final detailed Lovable prompt** for:

---

## ‚úÖ **Prompt 11: Daily Reconciliation Page (Cash & Credit Validation)**

*Handles closing of daily sales with confirmation of received cash vs expected sales value.*

---

### üìÑ Route: `/dashboard/reconciliation`

This page is used at the **end of day** by the **Manager** to:

1. Review all **nozzle readings** and generated **sales** for the day
2. Compare with **cash declared by attendants**
3. Confirm if any delta was due to **credit** or **online payments**

---

### üß≠ Flow Summary

* Each day, nozzle readings generate sales based on delta √ó fuel price
* Attendant must declare how much **cash** they received
* Manager sees **Expected Total**, **Cash Declared**, and must confirm the **delta**
* Delta must be reconciled: either marked as *credit*, *online payment*, or flagged for investigation

---

### üìã Reconciliation Table View

**Columns:**

| Nozzle | Previous Reading | Current Reading | Delta (L) | Price/Litre | Sale Value | Payment Method | Cash Declared |
| ------ | ---------------- | --------------- | --------- | ----------- | ---------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| #1     | 5000             | 10000           | 5000      | ‚Çπ100        | ‚Çπ500,000   | cash           | ‚Çπ20,000       |

**Below the table**, show:

* ‚úÖ **Total Sales Value**
* üíµ **Total Cash Declared**
* üí∞ **Delta Amount**
* üìù **Reconciliation Notes (textarea)**
* ‚è±Ô∏è **Date Picker** (default to today)

---

### üì• Form Submission

**Form Fields:**

* `stationId` (auto-filled)
* `date` (date of reconciliation)
* `totalExpected` (from sales)
* `cashReceived` (sum of declared cash)
* `reconciliationNotes` (optional)
* `managerConfirmation` (checkbox: ‚ÄúI verify the above amounts‚Äù)

```http
POST /v1/reconciliation
Headers: { x-tenant-id }
Body:
{
  "stationId": "uuid",
  "date": "2024-06-22",
  "totalExpected": 500000,
  "cashReceived": 20000,
  "reconciliationNotes": "Remaining via credit. Fleet payment pending.",
  "managerConfirmation": true
}
```

---

### üß© Required Components

| Component                   | Purpose                                            |

‚úÖ API is ready. Proceed to implement full workflow.

---

## ‚úÖ **Prompt 12: Dashboard Summary Charts & Metrics**

*Used by Owners and Admins to get a high-level view of business health.*

---

### üìä Route: `/dashboard/summary`

This is a visual dashboard for **Owners** and **Superadmins**. Shows key metrics with charts.

---

### üî¢ Metrics

1. **Total Sales (This Month)**
2. **Credit vs Cash Breakdown**
3. **Fuel Sold by Type**

### üìà Charts & Cards

| Widget                    | API                              | Type       |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Total Sales Card          | `/v1/sales?range=monthly`        | Card       |

* Each chart should have loading state, error handling
* Use `x-tenant-id` for all data requests

---

‚úÖ You may proceed with implementing both prompts. Let me know if you'd like to combine them into a **single Lovable prompt** for a unified implementation.


Excellent question ‚Äî and you're absolutely right to clarify this. Let's distinguish clearly how **summary dashboards** should behave for each role:

---

## ‚úÖ **Summary Dashboard by Role**

### üîí SuperAdmin Dashboard (Global Overview)

SuperAdmins don‚Äôt own stations, but they **oversee all tenants**. Their dashboard shows:

| Metric                  | Description                              |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| üî¢ Total Tenants        | Number of registered tenants             |
| üßë‚Äçüíº Active Users      | Total users across all tenants           |
| üè™ Total Stations       | All stations created                     |
| ‚õΩ Total Sales Volume    | Cumulative across all tenants (optional) |
| üí≥ Most Active Tenants  | Tenants with highest sales volume        |
| üìÖ Recent Registrations | New tenants signed up this week          |

**APIs (admin routes):**

```http
GET /admin/tenants/summary
GET /admin/users/summary
GET /admin/stations/summary
GET /admin/sales/summary
```

---

### üè† Owner Dashboard (Per-Tenant Overview)

Owners manage 1+ stations (depending on plan), and see:

| Metric                      | Description                     |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| üí∞ Total Monthly Sales      | Across all their stations       |
| üõ¢Ô∏è Fuel Sold by Type       | Petrol, Diesel, etc.            |
| üìà Sales Trend              | Per day or week                 |
| üí≥ Credit vs Cash Breakdown | Revenue source types            |
| ‚õΩ Station Statuses          | Station-wise sales volume today |

**APIs (tenant scoped):**

```http
GET /v1/sales/summary
GET /v1/sales/fuel-breakdown
GET /v1/sales/payment-methods
GET /v1/reconciliation/latest
```

---

### üßë‚Äçüîß Manager Dashboard (Station Operations)

Managers only see data for their assigned station(s):

| Metric                       | Description                  |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| ‚õΩ Nozzle-wise Fuel Dispensed | Daily stats                  |
| üßæ Pending Reconciliations   | Sales not yet closed         |
| üë∑ Staff On Duty             | Current assigned employees   |
| üíµ Cash vs Declared Amount   | Today's expected vs received |

---

## üß† Summary

So to answer your question:

> **"How will SuperAdmin have a summary?"**

‚úÖ **They will not see per-station data**, but instead have a **global metrics dashboard** about tenants, users, total system usage, and signups ‚Äî essentially a ‚Äúplatform health‚Äù view.

Would you like me to generate a dedicated **Lovable prompt** for **SuperAdmin Summary Dashboard** next?
