# STEP_fix_20251219.md — Price lookup client fix

## Project Context Summary
Running `npm run build` failed after recent merges. The `createCashReport` function passed the Prisma client to `getPriceAtTimestamp`, which expects a pg client. In `listStations`, the generated array was strongly typed and adding a `metrics` property caused a compile error.

## Steps Already Implemented
Backend phase 2 is finished through the 2025‑12‑18 fix for `getPriceAtTimestamp` typing.

## What Was Done Now
- Updated `createCashReport` to pass the transaction client and removed the unused Prisma import.
- Cast the array in `listStations` to `any[]` so metrics can be assigned.
- Installed dependencies and confirmed `npm run build` succeeds.

## Required Documentation Updates
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`
- `docs/PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`
