# STEP_fix_20251217.md — Station metrics compile fix

## Project Context Summary
Recent TypeScript builds failed after installing dependencies. The `listStations` function assigns a `metrics` property to each station object when the caller requests metrics. The parsed rows were strongly typed and did not allow this dynamic property, causing a compile error.

## Steps Already Implemented
Backend Phase 2 is complete with numerous fixes through 2025‑12‑16 including Node typings.

## What Was Done Now
- Cast the result of `parseRows` to `any[]` in `listStations` so the `metrics` property can be added.
- Verified `npm run build` succeeds.

## Required Documentation Updates
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`
- `docs/PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`
