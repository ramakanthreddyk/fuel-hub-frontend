# STEP_fix_20251218.md â€” Prisma client parameter fix

## Project Context Summary
A TypeScript error occurred when building because `getPriceAtTimestamp` expected a `TxClient` type that didn't align with `PrismaClient`. Passing the prisma instance from services resulted in a mismatch.

## What Was Done Now
- Modified `src/utils/priceUtils.ts` so the helper accepts `PrismaClient` directly.
- Ran `npm install` and `npm run build` to confirm the build succeeds without errors.

## Required Documentation Updates
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`
- `docs/PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`
