# STEP_fix_20251220.md — Apply documented Prisma price helper

## Project Context Summary
Documentation indicated `getPriceAtTimestamp` should accept a `PrismaClient` but the
code still used a PG pool client. Services calling the helper with the Prisma instance
failed to compile.

## Steps Already Implemented
Backend phase 2 fixes up to 2025‑12‑19 are complete. Local development instructions
include Docker-based setup and manual Postgres install.

## What Was Done Now
- Updated `src/utils/priceUtils.ts` to use `PrismaClient` and Prisma queries.
- Adjusted `createCashReport` and `createNozzleReading` to pass the Prisma client.
- Linked `docs/LOCAL_DEV_SETUP.md` from `README.md`.
- Verified `npm run build` succeeds.

## Required Documentation Updates
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`
- `docs/PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`
