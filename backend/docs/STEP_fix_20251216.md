# STEP_fix_20251216.md â€” Install Node type definitions

## Project Context Summary
TypeScript failed to compile because the project did not include `@types/node`. This dependency provides Node.js types for the build.

## What Was Done Now
- Added `@types/node` as a dev dependency.
- Ran `npm install` to update `package-lock.json`.
- Confirmed `npx tsc --noEmit` completes without errors.

## Required Documentation Updates
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_INDEX.md`
- `docs/PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md`
